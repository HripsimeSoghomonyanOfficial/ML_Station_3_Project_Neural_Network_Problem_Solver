# Neural Network Problem Solver

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a neural network model built using Scikit-learn to solve a binary classification problem. The goal is to predict the target class using features from the provided dataset.

## How to Get Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your dataset in the project folder as `your_dataset.csv`.
3. Run the provided Python code in a Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment.

## Running the Project
1. Install the required libraries:
    - `numpy`
    - `pandas`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `scikit-learn`
2. Ensure the dataset has the features as input columns and a `target` column for the output.
3. Execute the script step-by-step to train and evaluate the model.

## Libraries and Functions
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting training and validation curves.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building, training, and evaluating the neural network.

## Features of the Model
- A neural network implemented using Scikit-learn's `MLPClassifier`.
- Relu activation function for hidden layers.
- Logistic activation function for the output layer.
- Adam optimizer for training.

## Additional Details
- The dataset should be pre-labeled with a target column for binary classification.
- Training and validation curves are generated to visualize model performance over epochs.
- Accuracy and loss values are displayed for testing after model evaluation.
